This project consists of a backend and a frontend that need to be started separately. Please follow the instructions below to get both parts running.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Ensure you have it installed on your machine)
- A package manager (e.g., npm or yarn)

## Backend Setup

2. Follow the setup instructions in the backend repository's `README.md`.
3. Make sure the backend is running before proceeding to the frontend.

## Frontend Setup

1. Once the backend is up and running, clone and start the frontend project, which is located here: [ET Test Frontend](https://github.com/Filain/et-test-front).
2. Follow the setup instructions in the frontend repository's `README.md`.
3. After successful setup, the frontend should connect to the backend and function correctly.

## Notes
